Bulls and Cows - Bot Simulation in Python

We implemented the classic Cows and Bulls game using a positive four-digit integer.
The game is designed to be played by two bots that simulate their moves until one of them wins.
This project demonstrates basic logic, control flow, and simulation strategies using Python.

How it works
- Each bot selects a valid 4-digit number with unique digits.
- The bots take turns guessing each other's numbers.
- After each guess, feedback is given in terms of "bulls" (correct digit in correct place) and "cows" (correct digit in wrong place).
- The game continues until one bot guesses the opponent's number exactly.
